# Dictionary App

This project is a digital english dictionary!

This is a challenge where I will create a react native app.
This app is a digital english dictionary, made with React Native and Expo, and it's using Firebase as database, and it's using https://dictionaryapi.dev/ API for searching details about the words.

- Scroll in an infinite list of words!
- You will be able to see everything about a word, its meaning and its phonetics!
- You can save your favorite words to access them easily whenever you want to!
- You can see your history to easy remember the words you already searched for!

- We will keep any results of requested words, so we don't need to request again already known words.
- You can listen to the words thanks to https://responsivevoice.org/api
- Our project has Unit Tests.
- You can have your account with login and password, and with that, you can access your history and your favorite words in any device!
